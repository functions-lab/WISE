# Disaggregated deep learning via in-physics computing at radio frequency

In this repository, you can find two components of code in `WISE`:

a) the complex-valued machine learning model training and testing in digital [here](./ML/).

b) the analog computing simulations with randomized inputs and weights [here](./Hybrid/).

(The experimental codes are also included in this repo, but the instructions are upon request)
