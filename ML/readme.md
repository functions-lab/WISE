## The complex-valued machine learning model training and testing in digital

In this code, you can train the complex-valued machine learning model used in WISE.

### Step 1: Prepare the Dataset

Create folders for the dataset and models under this folder:

1. `mkdir Data`, which is the folder to store the dataset
2. Put the dataset under the folder `./Data/`, for example, the file named `mnist_train.csv`, which is available [online](https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/mnist_datasets/).
3. `mkdir Result`, which is the folder to output the machine learning models and results.

### Step 2: Machine Learning Model Training and Testing

1. `python main.py`
